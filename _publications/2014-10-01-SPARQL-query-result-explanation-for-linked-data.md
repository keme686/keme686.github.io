In this paper, we present an approach to explain SPARQLquery results for Linked Data where the main component in an expla-nation for a query is itswhy-provenance. We present a non-annotation-based algorithm to generatewhy-provenanceand show its feasibility forLinked Data. We present an explanation-aware federated query processorprototype and show the presentation of our explanations. We present auser study to evaluate the impacts of our explanations. Our study showsthat our query result explanations are helpful for end users to understandthe result derivations and make trust judgments on the results.
